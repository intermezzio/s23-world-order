# Wars of Decolonization, Third World, Cultural Revolution

## Activism in the 1960s

- Black freedom struggle in the South
- Nuclear threat in the Cold War
- Growing military industrial complex
- Popular complacency (American prosperity)
- Detached quietism of universities (not activism-focused)
- Sexual revolution, gender demands

## Asian Independence

- India gains independence but there's a violent Partition
- Netherlands want to keep Indonesia but don't
- Dien Bien Phu declares Vietnamese Independence but tries
to do it in an \`\`American" way, although the US does not
support them

## Chinese Cultural Revolution

- China 1966-1976
- Other communist parties put the communist party first
- e.g. USSR
- Now Mao Zedong says the people are above the party
- However this caused Mao to get a lot of personal
followers, primarily young people, who committed violent
crimes against older people who they saw as not communist

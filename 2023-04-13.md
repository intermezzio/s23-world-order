# Uses of Human Rights, Oil Crisis, Human Rights Wars

## Language of Human Rights

Used by...

- Women in the US and USSR used this language in the
1970s especially
- Grassroots organizations spearheaded this movement
- People in the Soviet bloc (East Germany, etc.)
- Chile, Argentinian governments (Southern Cone)
  which were dictatorships
- Amnesty International

## Nature of the Cold War

- Ideological battle, not as much preparation for war
- Lots of conversations took place between the US and
Soviet Union
- Helsinki Accords: 1975, US and USSR
  - Both parties acknowledge human rights
  - People didn't anticipate it causing citizens to
    demand these rights
- Attempts at DÃ©tente (demilitization)

## Oil Crisis

- In the 1910s, the UK switched its navy to oil power
  from coal
- In the 1940s, automobiles increased in popularity
- In the 1960s, it was used to create plastics
- Soon, oil is found in Latin America
- Then it is found in the Arabian Penninsula
- Private actors (companies) start to gain holdings
- US uses Ibn Alsaud (Saudi Arabia) as a puppet
- Not as violent as in the past
- Saudi Arabia named after Ibn Alsaud because the US
  told him they'd make him king if he made favorable
  oil policies for the US
- UK-Iran had an Anglo-Persian oil company
- Mosaddeq had unfavoriable oil practices for the UK
- The US staged a coup on Mosaddeq in 1953
- This Anglo-Persian oil company ended up renaming
  to BP, British Petroleum
- In the 1960s, OPEC was created as a cartel to control
  oil supply and output, majority Arab countries
- In 1973, OPEC acts out of line with the US for the
  first time after the Yom Kippur war
- In an act of opposition to Israel, they made an
  embargo on oil exports to countries that supported
  Israel
- The price of oil skyrocketed
- The steel belt in the US becomes the rust belt
  because the spike in oil prices puts them out of
  business
- Cars in the US became a lot smaller
- In 1974, the price of oil quadruples instead of an
embargo
- Saudi Arabia and other countries became very rich
  and had not much to do with it (petrodollars)
- Saudi Arabia began to lend a lot of money to banks
  in the US and London, also loans to Global South
  countries
- Interest rates became very low in the 1970s due
  to petrodollars
- New International Economic Order passed the assembly
  in the UN, stating
  - Colonialism may be over but there are other
    problems, like neocolonialism
  - Wanted reparations for colonialism
  - Commodity stabilization agreements
  - Radical structural demands for making reparations
    for the colonial past
- In 1979, the Volcker shock raised inflation rates
  in the US from almost zero to about 20%
- In 1982, there was a Third World Debt Crisis as a
  result of these interest rate increases
- The IMF was approached
- Structural adjustment programs were made for these
  countries that got saved from collapse in the
  1980s
  - Austerity Paradigm

### Antemarkets

- Produce scarcity by controlling supply
- Create a monopoly or cartel

## Jihad versus McWorld (the West)

### Jihad is seen as

- Cultural
- Anti-capitalist
- Anti-western

### While McWorld is seen as

- Economic
- Capitalist
- Western

### Not accurate because

- The US had close ties to Saudi Arabia against Iran and Egypt
- The US had much closer ties to religious Islamic regimes,
  fighting against more secular, socialist, "modern" nations
- Anti-colonial, not anti-capitalist
- Inaccurate conflation of territory, religion, and politics

# Inequality Regimes, Economic Governance, and Possibilities for Reform

## Inequality Regimes

- Neo-feudalism
- "Plutocratic elite" versus ordinary people
- Patriarchal system
- Legacies of colonialism and racial caste systems
- Petro-monarchy
- Ethnocracy
- Philanthropic Delusion

### Meritocracy

_The most talented are worth the most_

- Individualized failure and poverty
- Education as ladder of social mobility
- Education not class becomes education with class
- "Assortative mating", educated people marry educated people
- "Brahmin elite"

## 2008 Financial Crisis

- 1980s and onwards, especially the late 1990s
- Profits made in financial sectors greatly increase
- In 2008, many were worried about the US-China relationship
because China holds US debt
- What if China sold all treasury bonds?
- Actually cracked down in the US mortgage market
- Credit rating agencies are a mechanism of economic governance
- Banks gobbled up bundles of mortgages
- It turns out it wasn't just a US problem, Europe was heavily
involved too

### Response to Crisis

- Restore trust in investors
- Increase liquidity, buy non-voting equity
  - Keep in private hands to decrease risk of corruption
  - Buy "toxic assets"
- Quantitative Easing (QE)
  - Continuous monetary expansion
- Lower interest rates
  - More liquidity
- QE Era (2008-2020), zero interest rate policy
- Expanding balance sheet from 5-25% of GDP
- Gathering with G7 leaders and central bank heads
- International "swap lines"
- Realization that the European Central Bank (ECB) is more
powerful than the EU, European Council, Commission, and Parliament

# Great Divergence

## Setting of the Great Divergence

- England and the strongest Western Powers
- China as the Eastern Power

### Measuring Divergence

- Quality of life
- Economic structure
- Growth in GDP
- Exports versus imports
- Specialization of production (Smithian growth)
- Efficency, productivity (unit labor cost)

### Smithian Growth

- Free wage labor
- Free trade
- Mercantilism
- Accumulation of mineral wealth, e.g. silver
- Trade restricted to Empire
- Competition not monopoly
- Settler colonies

## Why only after 1800?

- Most of the world was agrarian
- Industrial revolution was different
- China had specialization
- Factor markets
- Japan had urbanization

## Differences that Explain Divergence

- Europe had state-supported, militarized expansion
of trade
- The Chinese state did not require war machines
or overseas empires to maintain global trade because
they were what the rest of the world wanted access to
- Industri**ous** revolution, or the production of
consumer products
- Europe had more access to coal than China, or at
least easier access to coal
- Europe had more cotton from plantations

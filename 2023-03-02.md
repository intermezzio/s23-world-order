# Thin Empire to Thick and Justifications for Imperialism

## Imperialism of Free Trade

- People are forced to open their borders to trade
- Gunboat diplomacy
  - Forced to trade or would get shot
- China was forced to have \`\`treaty ports" which let
European merchants under European law
- Lots of concessions and unequal treaties were signed
- Most-favored nation status

## India

> \`\`Jai Hind" - everyone (not really)

- By 1857, many states in India were either under direct
British control or heavily dependent on Britain's good will
- Don't depend on Britain's good will because it's not that
good
- Rumors spread that the EIC was using new ammunition that
had beef and pork in it, and because people needed to bite
off the casing for the ammunition to fight, Indian mercenaries
resisted
- With the establishment of Raj, the EIC is essentially a
thing of the past
- There were many famines as a result of the extractive
policies

### Caste

- British ruled through caste
- \`\`Martial races" -> Sikhs, Punjabis
- Invented traditions get internalized
- Originally had indirect authority to local rule

## Debt Imperialism

- Formally sovereign empires could get big loans from other
empires, putting them in the hands of their debtors

## 1884 Berlin Conference

- Suppression of slave trade
- Free trade
- Free passage through rivers
- Wage labor
- Religious toleration
- Protection of Christian missionaries
- Anti-monopoly
- _Terra nullius_: Africa is empty, we'll fill it

### _16 February 2023_

# Land and Slavery circa the 1600s

## Nature of Trans-Atlantic Slavery

- Grotesque details of exploitation
- Reminders of resistance
  - The effects are still ongoing
  - Restoring humanity
- Quantification is less useful when there are only
estimates; individual experiences share more insight
- Slave trade was folded into financial, insurance-based,
and accounting to normalize and dehumanize it for the
general public
  - Distance between commerce and labor
- A large player responsible for the rise of Western
civilization
- Leads to the expansion of consumer products, especially
sugar
- Life expectancy was much lower for slaves

## Private accumulation

- Enclosure turns the commons into commodities
- Commodities can be productive but oftentimes are just
luxury goods
- The capitalist system forces drastic changes in the
way of life for many people in order to optimize for
labor, oftentimes cutting wages as a means of keeping up
with competition

## Atlantic Slave Trade Routes Throughout History

- Largely in the Caribbean and Brazil
- From areas near Nigeria and Mozambique
- 1500s to 1860s

### Differences from Other Forms of Slavery

- Larger-scale
- Racial slavery
- Children were born into slavery
- Slaves were never incorporated into society
- Treated as commodities instead of people
- Permanent \`\`superiority" to slaves based on race
- Population was not self-sustaining
- People were essentially overworked to optimized for labor
potential as if they were a commodity
- \`\`Social Death"
- Supplying a distant markey with a specialized product
- Micromanaged workforce overseen by agent of owner who is
responsible for optimizing labor potential

## Resistance

- We should be wary of the fact that when we overestimate the
resistance of slaves it distracts from the inhumane practices
by which they were enslaved
- Some formed families even though it was illegal

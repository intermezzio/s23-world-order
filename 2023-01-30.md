# Explanations of Historical Change
## Networks and Systems, Religion and Commerce

# World versus Global History

World describes chronological events

- Separate cultures or civilizations in parallel
- Conflicts
- Population centers, focused on empires
- Governments
- Indigenous religions, doctrines
- Philosophy

Global implies interdependence

- Interlinkage or dependency of historical change
- Focus on borders, ports, courts, et cetera
- Syncretic practice
- Integration of religions
- Long-range \`\`knitting" of global culture over time
- Tolerance and cooperation across civilizations

## Rise of the West?

Abu-Lughod states that there were many actors and
religions, as well as many forms of economic activity.

Marx states that there's a changing relationship
between owners and workers.
There weren't necessarily capitalist origins of
imperialism

Weber states there's a unique Christian-derived culture
on psychology (primarily with the rise of Protestantism)

Marx and Weber have structural explanations of this
rise of the wesy, while Abu-Lughod focuses on
contingency to show that many other global factors led
to the rise of the west.

## Relations Across Powers

Elements of relations

- Local elites
- Intermediaries
- Imperial agents
- Contingent accomodation

Legitimation -> how powers attempt to appear legitimate
and claim authority

- i.e. divine power

## The Global System in the 1300s

Europe

- Genoa, Venice
- Champagne
- Constantinople

Middle East

- Alexandria, Cairo
- Baghdad
- Mecca

Indian Ocean

- Aden, Hormuz
- Cambay, Quilon

China

- Canton, Guangzhou
- Malacca (Singapore)

Cities are nodes in circuits and loops of trade.

Chokepoints are important to note as well.

In global history, trading posts and enclaves are
not necessarily political centers.

## Why did the 1300s Global Society Collapse?

- Mongols lost control of China, and they
demilitarized their navy (Ming rebellion)
- More exports than imports in Asian port cities,
giving power to Western buyers
- Black death (bubonic plague)
- Arrival of European powers

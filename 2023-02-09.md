# Composite Monarchy and a European Rise to Power

There was more parity than one might have expected at the time

## Political situation in Europe

Composite Monarchy

- Many different monarchies that were powerful in their own
right but not united
- Non-contiguous empires

### Spanish Monarchy

The Reconquista (AD 722-1492)

- Slowly recapturing the Iberian penninsula from the Moors
- No one expects the Spanish Inquisition
- Except they did
- Captured Grenada in 1492
- Mosques are turned into cathedrals
- Córdoba and Grenada

## Spanish and Portuguese Expansion

Treaty of Tordesillas

- Split colonies between Spain and Portugal across a longitude
line
- Portuguese get Brazil and East, Spain gets west

## Note!

Europe wasn't novel in its discoveries of advanced ships!
In fact, their ships are dwarfed by ships made by the Chinese
earlier that century, and the Chinese had made long-distance
travel like this before.

### _13 February 2023_

# Entrep√¥t Empire and Justification of Expansion

## Expanding into New Spain

- Expansionary settler empire in New Spain
- Primarily exporting silver
- Now they have something to trade with China!
- Finally. this silver from the Americas is trading
via the Pacific Ocean, Potosi, Argentina to Manila
- Potosi and Japan send silver to China

## Westphalia

- 1618-1648 large war in Europe
- Ended with a treaty viewed as one of the first
international treaties

### Westphalian Sovereignty

- There is no universal empire if neighboring
countries do not accept this
- Principle of territorial non-intervention
- Principle of internal control
- Principle of legal equality between states
- Tolerance for different religions, including
not just variants of Christianity but other religions,
too
- Within a state, any nation can do anything it wants
to its citizens

## Lawfare (as opposed to Warfare)

### Spanish Justification of Invasion

- The Spanish Monarchy claims a source of authority from
God himself and creates a law requiring conversion,
claiming that if they don't convert the Spanish have the
moral right to lay waste to and invade the indigenous
people
- Used the concept of \`\`just war" as opposed to
Westphalian thought
- If people cooperated, they were converted and had a
serfdom relationship
- Encomienda racial system, plus 20% of profits went to
the colonizer

### British Justification of Invasion

- Similar religious authority but with a more
\`\`philosophical" approach
- Here, God gives people land and their ability to work,
and therefore whoever labors the land owns the land
- Individuals own their own labor
- People are their own property, and when you mix labor
with land, the land becomes property of the laborer
- _Terra Nullius_, the best thing we can do is work and
labor the land
- The British used the land \`\`better" by developing it,
making it theirs

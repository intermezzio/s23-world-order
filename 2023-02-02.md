## Why do the Mongols Matter?

- Unified polity across Eurasia
- Expanded east-west trade routes
- Introduced multireligious form of rule
- Established Peking (Beijing) and Moscow while replacing cities they
sacked, like Baghdad
- Balance between violence and diplomacy
- Slightly less monarchy-esque monarchy
- Economic policies (e.g. progressive tax)
- Paiza (Mongol passport)

## How did the Mongols Conquer?

- Overwhelming force prompting surrender
- Co-opting local elites through defection
- Diplomacy through marriage
- Use of (allied) sons as military leaders
- Hereditary leadership but pass off to the \`\`best" son,
not the oldest
- Kinship networks + patronage networks (across families)
- Responsiveness to public grievances
- Fast horses that could survive the cold

## How did they Maintain Power?

- Contingent Allegiance
- Pragmatic subordination
- Treaty-making
- Khans converted to religions of conquered peoples
- Lots of religious tolerance
- Chinese Khanate established a racial hierarchy to
replace existing social structures
- Foreign leaders as opposed to self-governance in
China specifically

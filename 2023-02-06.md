# Succession and Multilegalism

## Ottomans and Religion

- _Gazi_ = holy war, especially the taking of Constantinople
by the Ottomans
- Regional autonomy / tolerance, Muslim hegemony but not
intolerance
- No corv√©e tax - this was a way to do labor in place of
paying tax (poll tax)
- Still had to pledge loyalty to the Sultan

## Ottomans and Succession

- Each concubine in the harem could have one child
- Concubines competing for power and influence
- Separating marriage and reproduction
- Especially important because marriages were for political
alliances and they didn't want these children to question
loyalty to the allied power
- Consolidation of power in Sultan's line
- Prevents alternative challenges to authority
- The harem was sent out to grieve upon the Sultan's death
- Not Muslim concubines because Muslims couldn't be enslaved
- This way, the concubines were \`\`naturalized" Ottomans
- Fratricide = killing off family after assuming power

## Status of Slaves as Authorities

- _Devshirme_ = collection of boys from the Balkans who were
naturalized and converted in order to serve as advisors to
the Sultan
- Become Janissaries, military leaders
- Unlike Mongols where only Mongols could fight in the military
- There were many uprisings from the Janissaries

## Serbian Speech in 1989 (Pre-war)

- Citing pre-Ottoman beliefs from 1389 as a reason to support
Serbian nationalism
- Identifying as part of the \`\`European bloc", including
a stronger identity with Western Christian Europe than the
more Ottoman-friendly parts of the Balkan region

## Turkish speech in 2020 (Hagia Sophia as a Mosque)

- Citing Ottoman ideology and identity from 1453 to support
converting the mosque
- Identifying as a continuation of the Ottoman Empire and
citing religious tolerance and hegemony as a reason to justify
the re-conversion to a mosque

### _21 February 2023_

# American Revolutions

## Historicizing

- How to portray history without personal bias
- What biases did people have when retelling the histories
of these revolutions?

## Productivity and Citizenship

### What Criteria are used to Classify Humanity?

- How productive people are in contributing to society
- Third Estate
  - Agricultural class
  - Merchants and brokers
  - Artisans
  - Domestic classes
- First, Second Estate
  - Lords
  - Clerics / Church
  - Government
- The Third Estate can exist without the others, not vice
versa
- The French Revolution was about sovereignty for the Third
Estate

## French Revolution

- Jaccaban Phase - the most \`\`hardcore" version of the
revolution
- Religion was deposed
- Men were active citizens, women were inactive citizens
- People who worked in the public sphere could vote
- Justified not giving women rights

### The Declaration of the Rights of Woman

- Right to form a contract and own property
- Notes that women are now subordinate to slaves
- Compares to slaves but is largely ignorant of what slaves
actually went through

## Haitian Revolution

- White elite claims rights because they're French, white,
and own property
- Gens du coleur had the same declarations except that they're
not white
- Poor whites used the same declarations except property
- Enslaved people claimed shared experience, culture, and
religion but also a desire for freedom
- Did not follow a nromal model of revolution
  - Circulation of texts
  - Educated leadership
  - Not led by the Third Estate, led by a member of the
  Church and nobility, people who would lose their power
  if they won the revolution

## Spanish Revolutions

- Largely a pro-monarchy movement
- Operated independently of indigenous people
- More liberal than French revolution
- More men had the right to vote, all except African
Americans because they were afraid of Haiti

# Globalizaiton, Modernity, Capitalism, and Empire

## Is there a pre-history of globalization?

- Globalization versus already globalized
- Term introduced in 1980s

National implies nation states

International coined 1789 = Intergovernmental

Transnational -> not governments, other people

This isn't a completed process because of universal
homogenous condition

Nominalism = is it useful to put words to these things?

Periodization

- 1492 Columbus
- 1571 New World Silver to China
- Late 19th century commodity price convergence

## Modernity

- Institutions (modernization)
- Thought (modernism)

Concepts

- Progress (temporality)
- Novelty
- Present + future
- Used to impose on other groups
- Implies continuous improvement
- Used to justify colonial intervention

Points

- Redefine modernity to be able to refer to \`\`precolonial"
times
- Alternative modernities
- Vernacular
- Indigenous modernity
- Early modern

History

Modernization theory from Walt Roston

Divides up the world into discrete, self-contained units

These units are what assumed to be nation states

Groups ranked by how \`\`modern" they are on a scale from
some random tiny country to the USA

Some define modern as the ability to be self-reflective, comparing
fixed status to social mobility and religion to secularity
and rural to urban society

## Capitalism

Merchant Capitalism

- Working for profit not subsistence
- Morally dubious

Bundle of institutions

- Mode of production
- Working class
- Wage work was only normalized in the 19^th^ century
- Not an empire because it's decentralized and doesn't have a
political order
- there's a distinction between public and private

## Empire

Empirical category
